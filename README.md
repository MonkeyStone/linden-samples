You can try sample application ([Get it in GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zzzzzzerg.linden.samples)), but be aware of buying real (managed) product.

Note: Don't buy managed product when purchase window appear. This is just a test button. Or if you buy managed - you can refund it (but I don't know how).
